# Backbone.js Overview

## What is Backbone.js?
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) is a **Front-end JavaScript (Web) Framework**. What does that mean, let's take each piece in turn:

- **Front-end**: this means that the code for the framework runs in a web browser and is intended to provide an application's user with all of their interaction options. For example, the front-end includes all of the HTML, CSS, images, and the means for communicating with the server when the user does something like click a button to save a form.
- **JavaScript**: this means that the code for the framework and your code using it are written in JavaScript. Because JS for the front-end is generally only used within browsers the "Web" part is implied.
- **Framework**: this is really the heart of the matter. A framework is a collection of code that your application uses as its starting point.
  
  The framework provides specific functionality and design decisions that guide the development of your application. Frameworks can also provide organizational recommendations or "opinions" about what code should go where, both in terms of specific classes/functions and the actual files and folders that code resides in.
  
  Rails is an example of a "Back-end Ruby Web Framework" and it provides the MVC design decision, as well as specific functionality such as ActiveRecord for using a DB, ERB templates for the view rendering, and the Rails Router. It also has some very strong opinions on exactly how your code should be organized.
